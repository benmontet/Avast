## Description
Stellar spectra are not constant in time.
There are effects of surface convection, flares, sunspots, rotation,
and stellar oscillations.
(In some stars, there can also be variable cloud cover, external eclipsing
bodies, variable interstellar material, or microlensing.)
Most or all of these sources of variability will lead to spectral changes,
and also brightness or (effective) radial-velocity changes.
They are important, therefore, for testing models of stars, and
also for making extremely precise measurements of stellar parameters
or radial velocities.

## Projects
- Comparison of multiple-visit spectra of the same star.
- Regression of stellar spectra against measured radial velocity.
- Searches for variance across stellar identical twins.
